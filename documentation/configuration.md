Vistio is configured via command-line flags and a configuration file.

### Command-line flags

- `--config.file` Vistio configuration file path. Default is `/etc/vistio/vistio.yaml`.
- `--log.level` The level of logging. Default is `info`.
- `--api.port` Port to listen on for API requests. Default is `9091`.
- `--retrieval.scrape-interval` How frequently to scrape metrics from prometheus servers. Default is `10s`.
- `--retrieval.scrape-timeout` How long until a scrape request times out. Default is `8s`.
- `--cache.size` The maximum number of snapshots can be cached. Default is `100`.
- `--storage.path` Base path of local storage for graph data. Default is `/vistio`.
- `--storage.retention` How long to retain graph data in the storage. Default is `168h`.

### Configuration file

This file contains configuration information for the traffic graph. Vistio reads this file to know where to send prometheus query and how to generate graph data from that query results.

Some valid example files are placed in `example` directory ([simple.yaml](https://github.com/nmnellis/vistio/blob/master/example/simple.yaml), [full.yaml](https://github.com/nmnellis/vistio/blob/master/example/simple.yaml)).

#### Graph data

Basically, a graph contains a list of nodes and connections. And we have 2 graph levels:
 - global level: contains `cluster` nodes and connections between those nodes
 - cluster level: contains `service` nodes and connections between those nodes.

Vistio will send the specified queries to Prometheus servers and generates nodes and connections.

Let's see how it works.

Suppose we have the following metrics on a prometheus server.

```
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s1",service="demo-s3",code="OK",foo="foovalue"} 10
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s1",service="demo-s3",code="Internal",foo="anything"} 1
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s1",service="demo-s3",code="NotFound",foo="bar"} 1
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s1",service="demo-s3",code="InvalidArgument",foo="test"} 2
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s2",service="demo-s3",code="OK",foo=""} 20
code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m{client="demo-s2",service="demo-s3",code="Internal",foo=""} 5
```

- example 1: Use the label value as the node name.

```
query: code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m
source:
    label: client
target:
    label: service
status:
    label: code
    warningRegex: ^InvalidArgument|FailedPrecondition$
    dangerRegex: Internal
```

3 nodes and 2 connections will be generated

```
nodes:
- "demo-s1"
- "demo-s2"
- "demo-s3"

connections:
- "demo-s1" -> "demo-s3": normal RPS = 11, warning RPS = 2, danger RPS = 1
- "demo-s2" -> "demo-s3": normal RPS = 20, warning RPS = 0, danger RPS = 5
```

- example 2: Want to remove prefix "demo" from node name.

```
query: code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m
source:
    label: client
    regex: ^demo-(.+)$
    replacement: $1
target:
    label: service
    regex: ^demo-(.+)$
    replacement: $1
status:
    label: code
    warningRegex: ^InvalidArgument|FailedPrecondition$
    dangerRegex: Internal
```

3 nodes and 2 connections will be generated

```
nodes:
- "s1"
- "s2"
- "s3"

connections:
- "s1" -> "s3": normal RPS = 11, warning RPS = 2, danger RPS = 1
- "s2" -> "s3": normal RPS = 20, warning RPS = 0, danger RPS = 5
```

- example 3: Want to add a connection notice with `severity=error` if the rate of `danger` RPS is greater than or equal to 0.1

```
query: code:grpc_server_requests_total:rate2m
source:
    label: client
target:
    label: service
status:
    label: code
    warningRegex: ^InvalidArgument|FailedPrecondition$
    dangerRegex: Internal
notices:
  - title: HighErrorRate
    statusType: danger
    severityThreshold:
       error: 0.1
```

3 nodes and 2 connections, 1 connection notice will be generated

```
nodes:
- "demo-s1"
- "demo-s2"
- "demo-s3"

connections:
- "demo-s1" -> "demo-s3": normal RPS = 11, warning RPS = 2, danger RPS = 1
- "demo-s2" -> "demo-s3": normal RPS = 20, warning RPS = 0, danger RPS = 5
   - notice: "HighErrorRate", severity = "error"
```
